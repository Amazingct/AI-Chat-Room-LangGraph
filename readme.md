# Main.py

Main.py is the heart of our project, serving as the primary script that drives the functionality of our application.

## Description

Main.py is the backbone of our application, leveraging the power of the Langchain API to perform complex language processing tasks. It creates a simulated environment of a chat room, populated with AI-driven experts and a moderator. The chat room is more than just a conversation space; it's a dynamic, interactive platform where users can ask questions and gain insights on a wide range of topics. The application is built on the robust Streamlit framework, a popular choice for developing machine learning and data science web applications.

## How it works

The application employs advanced AI and the Langgraph library to create a realistic chat room simulation. This virtual room is filled with AI experts, each capable of answering questions and providing valuable insights on a multitude of topics. To maintain a conducive and respectful environment, a moderator is always present in the chat room, ensuring that the conversation remains focused and productive.
